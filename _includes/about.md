<h2 id="about" style="margin: 2px 0px 10px;">About me</h2>

I am a computer science Ph.D. student at UCSD where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mihir Bellare](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/). I am broadly interested in cryptography and provable security. 

At UCSD, I am part of the [CryptoSec](https://cryptosec.ucsd.edu/) and [Theory](https://cstheory.ucsd.edu/home.html) groups. Previously, I spent two years at Microsoft working as a software engineer after completing my B.E in Computer Science and Engineering at BIT, Mesra.
